                <h3>About Dr Fox</h3>

                <p>
                It has been my honor to serve as your mayor these past four years. In that
time, Burning Man has grown from 50,000 people to more than 65,000. During my
tenure, the event sold out for the first time, as it has every time since.
                </p><p>
But the position of mayor is not about the event; it’s about the city. It's
about the community and the people who raise it out of the dust.

                </p><p>
In last year’s State of the City address, I promised that I would continue
working hard for you, and I have. We put into effect Our Burning Man Traffic
Mitigation Plan, which limited admission to the city to only 35,000 vehicles
and requiring an additional fee for each.
                </p><p>
                But there is more work to be done.
                </p>

                <h3>From the Fox's mouth:</h3>
                
<dl>
  <dt>What does being mayor of BRC entail?</dt>
  <dd>Legally speaking, the mayor speaks for both the government and the
community. As mayor, I have all the powers and duties for the office
of council-member in addition to those of mayor, effectively making me
part of the Burning Man Organization while holding the post, though
they don't agree with me on that point.</dd>
  <br />
  <dt>What are the biggest challenges of your mayorship?</dt>
  <dd>We are an incredibly diverse city in ways that most cities aren't. I
govern according to the Ten Principles, to the best of my ability, but
it can be challenging to fairly engage with all extremes of that
diversity without compromising on those principles. That's become
easier over the years, and I think the record shows that I've done
well in this regard.</dd>
  <br />
  <dt>Why don't more people know about the BRC mayoral election? How do you plan
to raise awareness?</dt>
  <br />
  <dd>The majority of Burners have been coming for three or fewer years. Of
the remaining minority, many weren't here during an election year,
which is every four years. So only a small fraction have experienced a
Black Rock City election and there's simply not much discussion of it
during non-election years.
  </dd>
  <br />
  <dt>Why should people vote for you?</dt>
  <dd>Not everyone sees Black Rock City as a vibrant, diverse, unique
community. Some see it as a party. I fear this will destroy the city
and unmake the event as we know it. In the four years of my tenure,
we've seen unprecedented growth but not at the expense of our culture.
That can be a difficult balance, but under my leadership we've managed
it. I don't want us to lose this forward momentum. A vote for me is a
vote for the Ten Principles.</dd>
  <br />
  <dt>What's your hope for the future of Black Rock City?</dt>
  <dd>I hope we can continue moving forward as a community---building art,
meeting each other, living with immediacy, gifting, and growing---with
me as your mayor. On Friday (before the Saturday of burn night),
please remember: vote for Dr Fox.</dd>

My opponent isn’t taking this seriously. He’s tempting you with easy answers
and has no understanding of the challenges associated with representing a city.
He’s the candidate of the weekend warriors and the frat boys and the gawking
perverts and all the rest of the yahoos who infest our camps and leave their
trace everywhere.
                </p><p>
My opponent wants to glorify unmoderated hedonism and minimize our spectacular
accomplishments.

                </p><p>
You’ve put hundreds of hours into an art piece. You’ve poured your soul into
your work. The Dillman wants to trivialize your efforts.
